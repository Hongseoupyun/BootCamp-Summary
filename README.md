# BootCamp-Summary

## Week 1

- Version Control=>Git

- Git workflow :
```git clone/git init``` --> WORK WORK WORK --> ```git status (to check what files we worked on) ```--> ```git add .(to stage ALL files)``` --> ```git commit``` --> ```git push``` (so our work goes into github)

- Command line argument using ``` process.argv ```

- JavaScript ES6 Template Literal:
```const name = 'Alice';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); // logs: Hello, Alice!
```

- Writting Pseudocode
```for (let num = 100; num <= 200; num++) {
  if (num % 3 === 0 && num % 4 === 0) {
    console.log("LoopyLighthouse");
  } else if (num % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Loopy");
  } else if (num % 4 === 0) {
    console.log("Lighthouse");
  } else {
    console.log(num);
  }
}
```

```
Loop from 100 to 200:
  Let num = the current step in the loop
  If num % 3 is equal to 0 and num % 4 is equal to 0:
    Print "LoopyLighthouse"
  Else if num % 3 is equal to 0:
    Print "Loopy"
  Else if num % 4 is equal to 0:
    Print "Lighthouse"
  Otherwise
    Print num
  End if
End loop
```

- Scope in JavaScript (Global and Local)

- Truthy and Falsey (==, ===)

``` 
False
// False is False. Makes sense, right?

0
// 0 is the only falsey Number

""
// an empty string is falsey

null
// a null, or empty value, is falsey.

undefined
// an object that has not been defined is considered falsey.

NaN
// Not a Number. You'll learn more about NaN as we go on.

```

- Object in JavaScript

```
let car = {
    brand: 'toyota',
    model: 'GT86',
    year:  2019,
    transmissionType: 'manual'
  }
```
```  
value MUST have a specific key.

Objects are denotes with {} brackets 
```
- Functions in JavaScrit

- Callback Function

```
A callback function is a function, that is a parameter that goes into another function (high order function).

The high order function may call that function.
```

## Week 2

- Test Driven Development(TDD)

``` TDD is the idea of TDD is that the tests are developed for your code before actually writing the code.```

- Automated testing scripts in Mocha and Chai

- Module.exports the function to be tested

- Synchronous and Asynchronous
